# Control-Buttons
## First task
Greetings, friends!
This project targets the recording and storage of the robot's movement commands in a database.
The main webpage includes a user interface with five prominent buttons for controlling the robot's movements. Clicking on any of these buttons will trigger a notification confirming that "The button has been added successfully"
